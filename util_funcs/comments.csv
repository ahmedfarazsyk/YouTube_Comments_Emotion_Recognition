"I' have learned and practiced C++ years ago ...and after that Java for 5 years more easily (in practice ) bc of its graphic librairy, ...and then JavaFX for relative modern design..But Python ( an object oriented language to).... - unfortunately?- not a "" typed data language in external"", has become the most used in AI ...i wonder why ü§î",surprise

I'm a final year MEng CS and AI student and am going to start polishing my coding skills and projects before the end of the year to land a PhD or Grad Role as a ML/AI Engineer. Really appreciate the videos and advice, keep it up and best of luck with your career!!",admiration
"But reading books takes time and effort which I don't have. I am far too busy (and smart) to be reading books. I would rather binge watch a flashy course at 2x speed at 2 AM (after my 4 hour gaming sessions) and  finish it in a week. After a week of highly active engagement with the material, I can confidently slap ""AI Expert"" on my resume and wait for the silicon valley to drool over my resume, or I could sell AI automations to businesses and make easy $100K+/month or more!
Books is for kids or big dum dums who don't know how to play it smart.

PS: Forgot to mention I watch Rick and Morty!",neutral
"Thank you for your recommendations.  I really like AI ML  stuff,  I wish to be AI Engineer ,  but I thought I am not very good at math and stats hence I was confused should I go for it but finally I have decided to try go for an AI  career.  I have a question ,  do organizations expect a Masters Degree from candidates ?  I have undergraduate degree but  I have absolutely no patience to get into Post graduate .",confusion
"Thanks for the video.  You mention here it's good to learn backend languages as well, like Java, Go & Rust. Python is also used as a backend language. I wish to know what you are specifically trying to say by mentioning these three languages.? ",gratitude

"Hey, im a subscriber from india and i just wanted to show my appreciation for the videos you make for people like me who are confused in this field. I am currently in the phase where i'll join a university and im confused, Which branch should i take? Like the university i am joining has different courses like computer science engineering, computer science with ai specialisation, btech in AIML, and btech in AI and data science. So as far as i researched, the aiml course will teach basics of computer science but not go deep into it. So, im really confused what should i apply for? The good old computer science engineering or Computer science with ai specialisation or just AIML.",confusion
"my question is whether we can start from any of these fields or there is a step by step process, like we have to start from ml concepts,then shift to deep learning or something like that.",confusion
Amazing recommendations!,admiration
"Hey Egor, Thx for the info‚Ä¶ I hv 20+ yrs exp in semiconductor industry mostly into chip designing with very basic coding knowledge. I hv stopped hands-on for last 8-9 yrs after getting into mgmt ladder‚Ä¶ but I do guide teams technically whenever needed‚Ä¶.I am looking to learn AI primarily for better opportunities within/outside my organisation and looking to achieve better efficiency & productivity in semiconductor or related industry‚Ä¶where AI penetration is not fully in yet, I do see there is still a lot of scope to make a bigger impact using AIML‚Ä¶.

My queries :-

1. What to focus on AI domain and what expertise should I develop from your recommended AI roadmap to fulfil my goal in next 1-2 years? 
2. I am wondering how much time would it take to master or atleast get sufficient knowledge based on your experience towards my goal. 

Pls suggest if you or anyone has any suggestions or inputs ‚Ä¶ Thx in advance !",curiosity

"All the suggestions of these courses are super misleading. I guarantee to you even if you read all these books and complete the courses, you will NOT get a job as an AI engineer. You don't need to cover all these maths in depth. Plus, finishing all these courses won't give even a fraction of experience on how AI is used and scaled in the enterprises. very outdated",disapproval

You literally didn't list the most important machine learning book all Masters and PhD students have and are taught with in University. The Bishop book - Deep learning.

Bro do i need to study all the sources or anyone ?,curiosity
"I‚Äôm sceptical of books like Practical Statistics for Data Scientists and Mathematics for Machine Learning. I‚Äôve read both, and the topics are explained superficially, not in a way that‚Äôs accessible for beginners. I‚Äôd only recommend them if you're already familiar with the subject and just want a quick refresher, without expecting to explore anything in depth.

In the case of Mathematics for Machine Learning, you're better off choosing dedicated introductory books for each major topic. For example, one focused solely on linear algebra, another on calculus, another on probability and statistics, and so on.",approval
"Is there any youtuber that has a PHD in machine learning or deep learning that has book recommendations on how to master machine learning and deep learning basics, intermediate, advanced and research level topics by giving his book recommendations on every one of these stages?

Hi Egor. Did you at any point learn cloud or is it something you just learned on the job? I'm currently doing the Machine Learning Specialization course and I'm planning to do the Deep Learning Specialization afterwards. I would later like to do the AWS Machine Learning Nanodegree for practical experience but it seems it has cloud knowledge as a prerequisite. I assume it's the same with the Zero to Mastery course.,curiosity
