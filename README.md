# YouTube Comments Emotion Recognition

This project aims to analyze YouTube comments and detect the emotions expressed in them. It uses the YouTube API to fetch comments from any given YouTube video and then applies a natural language processing (NLP) model to classify the emotions present. The project generates word clouds based on different sentiments, providing insights to content creators on how their video is being perceived by their audience.

## Features

- Fetches comments from a specified YouTube video using the YouTube API.
- Analyzes the sentiment of each comment using the EmoRoBERTa model.
- Classifies emotions into categories such as positive, negative, neutral, and more.
- Generates word clouds for different sentiments to visually represent the dominant emotions in the comments.
- Helps YouTubers understand the emotional response to their video based on user feedback in comments.
